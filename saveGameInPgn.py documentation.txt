This py file has the main code about how to save tags and moves of a chess game in a PGN File. 

You just have to run it to see it working, be carefull to have a good "savedGames.pgn" file access (easily accessible). 

This code is easy to implement, just pay attention to open the file before editing it.

In savedGames.pgn we can find many games. Each game is represented by a tag list (event, black, white...) and a list of the deplacements
done during the game.
